# Tensile-Tester-Machine
Design and production of a lower cost and student-level version of the test device used in the industrial field that is used to produce stress strain graphs of materials.
The device is commonly known as a "Çekme Makinası" in Turkish, which translates to "Tensile Tester Machine" in English, fitting for our field of study and the language of our course.
In its simplest form, this machine is used to create the "Stress-Strain" graph, which is crucial in determining the elasticity, yield strength, and fracture points of materials.
Due to budget limitations, we couldn't create an industrial-grade device, so we designed a machine that pulls spaghetti noodles.
We applied pulling forces to both dry and cooked noodles, enabling us to observe their behavior under different conditions.
To measure elongation, we utilized a step motor and multiplied the distance covered by the pulling component in a single step in the vertical plane. 
This yielded an approximate value of 200 micrometers.
For force measurement, we employed a load cell sensor. 
All these values were collected using an Arduino MEGA board and processed using an Excel application on a computer. 
The real-time nature of capturing and processing data to generate the graph was truly exciting for us, once we set aside the margin of error.
The graph in the video corresponds to the cooked noodles, resulting in a curve with a relatively low slope that aligned with our expectations.
